    name: Pepperoni,

    info: Pepperoni is made from a mixture of ground pork and beef mixed with spices and 
    flavorings. Salt and sodium nitrate are then added as curing agents, which prevent the growth of 
    unwanted microorganisms. Nitrate is also added, which gives pepperoni its color.

     recipe starts with my homemade pizza crust and is finished with a sprinkle of crispy bacon.
